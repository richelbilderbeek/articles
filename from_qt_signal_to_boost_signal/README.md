# From Qt signal to Boost signal

This [article](CppArticle.htm) describes why and how to move from using
[Qt signals](CppQtSignal.htm) to using [Boost
signals](CppBoostSignal.htm).

## Introduction

The first paragraph contains arguments why to move from [Qt
signals](CppQtSignal.htm) to [Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm) and
when you might refrain from it. The second paragraph and beyond follow
the transition in code for two very simple [classes](CppClass.htm).

## Why move from [Qt signals](CppQtSignal.htm) to [Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm)?

My personal reasons for moving from [Qt signals](CppQtSignal.htm) to
[Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm), are:

-   When a [library](CppLibrary.htm) supports [Boost](CppBoost.htm), but
    conflicts with [Qt](CppQt.htm)
-   [Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm) do not require the seperation of
    a [class](CppClass.htm) in a [header (.h)file](CppHeaderFile.htm)
    and [implementation (.cpp) file](CppImplementationFile.htm) (because
    [Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm) do not require the use of
    [moc](CppMoc.htm))
-   Because the [STL](CppStl.htm), [TR1](CppTr1.htm) and
    [Boost](CppBoost.htm) [libraries](CppLibrary.htm) are 'the number
    one [libraries](CppLibrary.htm)' \[1\]\[2\]
-   I prefer using standard [C++](Cpp.htm) [keywords](CppKeyword.htm)
    only

Arguments against moving from [Qt signals](CppQtSignal.htm) to [Boost
signals](CppBoostSignal.htm) are:

-   The [Qt signal](CppQtSignal.htm) syntax is easier to read and write
-   When using only [Qt](CppQt.htm), adding the [Boost
    signals](CppBoostSignal.htm) [libraries](CppLibrary.htm) increase
    [compile](CppCompile.htm) time

## The program's goal

The program implements two classes: an emitter and a receiver. After
connecting the signals and slots, the emitter emits a signal, received
by the receiver.

 

[main](CppMain.htm) should be:

```

int main()
{
  //Create emitter
  //Create receiver
  //Connect emitter's signal to receiver
  //Let emitter emit its signal
}
```

Screen output should be like:

```
Emitter: emitting signal
Receiver: received signal
``` 

## CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal1: the ideal starting point

-   [Download the Qt Creator project
    'CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal1' (zip)](CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal1.zip)

 

The code below would be the ideal starting point. But because
[moc](CppMoc.htm) requires the seperation of a [class](CppClass.htm) in
a [header (.h)file](CppHeaderFile.htm) and [implementation (.cpp)
file](CppImplementationFile.htm), this code results in the [link
error](CppLinkError.htm) [undefined reference to 'vtable for
\[...\]'](CppLinkErrorUndefinedReferenceToVtableForMyDialog.htm). Due to
this, next step is to seperate the [class](CppClass.htm) in a working
example.

``` 
#include <iostream>
#include <QObject>

class QtEmitter : public QObject
{
  Q_OBJECT
public:
  void DoEmit()
  {
    std::clog << "QtEmitter: emitting signal\n";
    emit signal_emit();
  }
signals:
  void signal_emit();
};

class QtReceiver : public QObject
{
  Q_OBJECT
public slots:
  void OnReceive()
  {
    std::clog << "QtReceiver: received signal\n";
  }
};

int main()
{
  //Create emitter
  QtEmitter e;
  //Create receiver
  QtReceiver r;
  //Connect emitter's signal to receiver
  QObject::connect(&e,SIGNAL(signal_emit()),&r,SLOT(OnReceive()));
  //Let emitter emit its signal
  e.DoEmit();
}
```
 
## CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal2: the working starting point

-   [Download the Qt Creator project
    'CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal2' (zip)](CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal2.zip)

The code below would be the working starting point. The next step is to
replace the [Qt signals](CppQtSignal.htm) by [Boost
signals](CppBoostSignal.htm).


### main.cpp

```
#include "qtemitter.h"
#include "qtreceiver.h"

int main()
{
  //Create emitter
  QtEmitter e;
  //Create receiver
  QtReceiver r;
  //Connect emitter's signal to receiver
  QObject::connect(&e,SIGNAL(signal_emit()),&r,SLOT(OnReceive()));
  //Let emitter emit its signal
  e.DoEmit();
}
``` 
 

### qtemitter.cpp

```
#include <iostream>
#include "qtemitter.h"

void QtEmitter::DoEmit()
{
  std::clog << "QtEmitter: emitting signal\n";
  emit signal_emit();
}
```

### qtemitter.h


```
#ifndef QTEMITTER_H
#define QTEMITTER_H

#include <QObject>

class QtEmitter : public QObject
{
  Q_OBJECT
public:
  void DoEmit();
signals:
  void signal_emit();
};

#endif // QTEMITTER_H
```


### qtreceiver.cpp

```
#include <iostream>
#include "qtreceiver.h"

void QtReceiver::OnReceive()
{
  std::clog << "QtReceiver: received signal\n";
}
``` 

### qtreceiver.h

```
#ifndef QTRECEIVER_H
#define QTRECEIVER_H

#include <QObject>

class QtReceiver : public QObject
{
  Q_OBJECT
public slots:
  void OnReceive();
};

#endif // QTRECEIVER_H
``` 
 

## CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal3: the conversion to [Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm)

-   [Download the Qt Creator project
    'CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal3' (zip)](CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal3.zip)

 

In the code below, the [Qt signal](CppQtSignal.htm) is replaced by using
a [Boost signal](CppBoostSignal.htm). The next step is: can we put all
this code in a single file?

 

### emitter.cpp

```
#include <iostream>
#include "emitter.h"

void Emitter::DoEmit()
{
  std::clog << "Emitter: emitting signal\n";
  m_signal();
}
``` 

### emitter.h

```
#ifndef EMITTER_H
#define EMITTER_H

#include <boost/signals2.hpp>

struct Emitter
{
  void DoEmit();
  boost::signals2::signal<void ()> m_signal;
};

#endif // EMITTER_H
```

### main.cpp

```

#include "emitter.h"
#include "receiver.h"

int main()
{
  //Create emitter
  Emitter e;
  //Create receiver
  Receiver r;
  //Connect emitter's signal to receiver
  e.m_signal.connect(
    boost::bind(
      &Receiver::OnReceive,
      r));
  //Let emitter emit its signal
  e.DoEmit();
}
```

### receiver.cpp

```

#include <iostream>
#include "receiver.h"

void Receiver::OnReceive()
{
  std::clog << "Receiver: received signal\n";
}
```

### receiver.h

```

#ifndef RECEIVER_H
#define RECEIVER_H

struct Receiver
{
  void OnReceive();
};

#endif // RECEIVER_H
``` 

## CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal4: [Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm) in a single file
 

-   [Download the Qt Creator project
    'CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal4' (zip)](CppFromQtSignalToBoostSignal4.zip)

 

In the code below, all the code is placed a single file, and it works
fine!

```
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/signals2.hpp>

struct Emitter
{
  void DoEmit()
  {
    std::clog << "Emitter: emitting signal\n";
    m_signal();
  }
  boost::signals2::signal<void ()> m_signal;
};

struct Receiver
{
  void OnReceive()
  {
    std::clog << "Receiver: received signal\n";
  }
};

int main()
{
  //Create emitter
  Emitter e;
  //Create receiver
  Receiver r;
  //Connect emitter's signal to receiver
  e.m_signal.connect(
    boost::bind(
      &Receiver::OnReceive,
      r));  //Let emitter emit its signal
  e.DoEmit();
}
``` 

## Conclusion

There are reasons to move from using [Qt signals](CppQtSignal.htm) to
using [Boost signals](CppBoostSignal.htm). This article shows that this
is easy.
