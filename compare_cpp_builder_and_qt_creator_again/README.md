## Discussion

Below, I discuss the three items I encountered most in detail: writing
console applications, writing GUI applications and documentation needed
to learn both [IDEs](CppIde.htm).

### Console applications

In the previous article, I stated that developing console applications
in both [IDE](CppIde.htm)'s was easy. But not only does the [Qt
Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) support [Boost](CppBoost.htm) fully (as far
as I know), but an enormous amount of other [libraries](CppLibrary.htm)
as well. This boosts (no pun intended) productivity heavily! I do know
that Embaracadero is working on this, for [C++
Builder](CppBuilder.htm)'s successor called for RAD Studio.

What I did not highlight in the previous article, is that [C++
Builder](CppBuilder.htm) and its applications run under Windows only.
Except for platform-specific [libraries](CppLibrary.htm), I see no
reason to limit oneself to Windows.

### [GUI](CppGui.htm) applications

In the previous article, I stated that the GUI designer in [C++
Builder](CppBuilder.htm) was less cluttered with windows. To increase
working space, I learned to set the Widget pane to 'Icon View', so I
could push it to a width of two centimeters. This does not work with the
text-based sidebars on the right. I hope that in a future version, this
sidebar can be hidden by a shortcut-key.

I still believe that it is easier to learn [C++
Builder](CppBuilder.htm): one can use [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm)
without knowing how to design [classes](CppClass.htm). In [Qt
Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) one sometimes has implement
sub-[classes](CppClass.htm) and override behavior (for example, when one
wants to imlement a clickable [QLabel](CppQLabel.htm)). Although I
believe this design choice of the Qt [library](CppLibrary.htm) is good,
I think it is more difficult for beginners: they will have to struggle
with [classes](CppClass.htm) first, before they will understand how to
do this.

What I did not mention earlier about the Qt and [C++
Builder](CppBuilder.htm) architectures, is that the Qt architecture is
const-correct, unlike [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm). This aspect makes
it easier to understand Qt: a const method promises not to modify its
members. In [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm), this is not promised at all.

[QLabel](CppQLabel.htm) is a QWidget to display both text and images.
Why this is not seperated in two widgets remains unknown to me. And I
discovered that [QLabel](CppQLabel.htm) does not emit a signal when it
is clicked. If [QLabel](CppQLabel.htm) would only display text, I would
agree with this design choice: a clickable label can be mimicked by a
flat QButton. But I do wished that an image would emit a signal when
clicked: I use many images as flashy buttons. Personally, I would
suggest two solutions to the problem:

  * 1. let [QLabel](CppQLabel.htm) emit a signal when clicked, or
  * 2. add a QImage widget that emits a signal when clicked

Adding a custom method to a dialog is still tedious in [Qt
Creator](CppQtCreator.htm), but one gets used to it:

  * 1. add the declaration of the slot to the dialog's declaration, for
    example 'private slots: void OnButtonClick();'
  * 2. in the dialog constructor, connect a signal to this slot, for
    example
    'QObject::connect(ui-&gt;button,SIGNAL(clicked()),this,SLOT(OnButtonClick()));'
  * 3. write down the method definition, for example
    'void Dialog::OnButtonClick() { /\* your code \*/ }'

In [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm), this was done within three (really!)
clicks: click on 'Events' of the Object Inspector, then double-click on
the signal you want to respond to.

For the layout managent of the visual components, I have learned to
appreciate the work that all QLayouts do: for simple layouts they do a
great job. But when I want to add certain constraints, this still too
often results in unexpected behaviour: for example, I once had an
application of which I could resize the window to a bigger size, but it
could not be resized to a smaller surface. So, I still think that the
[C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm) TPanels were more intuitive to use.

It hadn't occurred to me before, to note that [Qt
Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) does not have any non-visual QWidgets. Sure,
if a widget is visual by definition, this is logical. But [C++
Builder](CppBuilder.htm) supplied non-visual TComponents, that could be
placed on the window (but never be seen). This has two advantages:

  * 1. it is easier, quicker and safer to manipulate widgets at design
    time. For example, for the [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm) TTimer, one can
    set the time, if it already runs, and which method gets called
    after timeout. From then on, the TTimer gets created and deleted by [C++
    Builder](CppBuilder.htm). In [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.htm), one have to
    write a QTimer declaration, set its timeout, set if its started, connect
    it to a method, and delete it, each by one line of code
  * 2. a beginner can find the functionality needed and experiment with it.
    I find it hard to imagine how a beginner would discover to use a QTimer.
    In [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm), everybody will discover TTimer within
    the first hours

### Documentation

I have learned that the Qt documentation is very good. Note the word
'learned': the Qt documentation has a learning curve, due to:

  * 1. when searching the documentation about a topic like '2D graphics',
    there are multiple ways
    (QPainter,QGraphicsView,[QLabel](CppQLabel.htm)), some ways using
    [classes](CppClass.htm) that are connected to (for a beginner: too) many
    [classes](CppClass.htm), for example when trying to use QGraphicsView,
    QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsItem
  * 2. if you do know the names, and/or do not understand to override
    virtual functions, for example 'paintEvent', it is unclear how to use
    some widgets. For example, if you want to use a QPainter, the
    documentation states: 'The common use of QPainter is inside a widget's
    paint event'. Although the documentation subsequently shows how to
    override the method 'paintEvent', I thought that 'paintEvent' was 'just
    a name'

So, if you understand the documentation of Qt, its content is as good as
C++ Builder's.

Still, there are two thingss:

  * 1. Because [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm) is easier to learn (as I
    stated above), I nearly ever needed to use its documentation for VCL
    [classes](CppClass.htm)
  * 2. Unlike the Qt documentation, [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm) also
    documents [STL](CppStl.htm) classes

Summarizing this:

  * 1. The [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) documentation documents its Qt
    [classes](CppClass.htm) as well as [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm)
    documents its VCL classes
  * 2. The [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) documentation takes time to
    understand, the [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm) documentation is more
    intuitive
  * 3. Unlike [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm), the [Qt
    Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) documentation lacks [STL](CppStl.htm) classes
    documentation

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

My personal conclusion has remained the same:

  * 1. [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.htm) is easier to learn
  * 2. the extra effort learning [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) is worth
    it, because [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.htm) is cross-platform and has a
    superior compiler
